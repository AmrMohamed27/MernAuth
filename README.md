- **JWT Authorization**: JSON Web Tokens are used to authorize and secure API routes.
- **User Sessions**: The app manages user sessions and keeps users logged in across page reloads.
- **Form Validation**: Uses Zod and react-hook-form for input validation and form handling.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with ShadCN components for a clean, responsive user experience.

## Tech Stack
